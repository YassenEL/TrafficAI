Traffic AI is a computer vision project that uses **YOLOv8** to detect and classify vehicles from traffic camera footage.  
The system collects data from real-world intersections, analyzes congestion levels by time of day, and generates traffic metrics that could be used to support **adaptive traffic signal systems** in the future.
